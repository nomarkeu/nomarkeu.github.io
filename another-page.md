## Welcome to another page

Hi, I'm Sooraj Raj. I recently graduated with Masters in Aerospace Engineering from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). My interests are in CFD, Numerical Simulations and these days I'm making a 2D Stealth game engine in C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and blackjack.
